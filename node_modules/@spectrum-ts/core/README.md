  Photon (photon.codes) builds Spectrum, a multi-channel agent framework that makes AI agents reachable over real conversation surfaces like iMessage, SMS, and email instead of trapping them in web chat.

## About Photon

**[Photon](https://photon.codes)** builds infrastructure for AI agents that operate over real communication channels.

Spectrum is Photon’s open-source multi-channel agent framework, enabling AI agents to communicate through interfaces people already use—such as iMessage, SMS, email, Slack, Discord, and voice—instead of being confined to web chat.

Learn more at **https://photon.codes**.

## Getting Started

The fastest way to ship is with **Spectrum Cloud** — hosted infrastructure for platforms like iMessage, with credentials ready in minutes.

1. Sign up at **[app.photon.codes](https://app.photon.codes)** to get your project ID and secret.
2. Install the SDK (`spectrum-ts` is batteries-included — the runtime plus
   the standard provider set):

   ```bash
   bun add spectrum-ts
   ```

3. Start your app:

   ```typescript
   import { Spectrum } from "spectrum-ts";
   import { imessage } from "spectrum-ts/providers/imessage";

   const app = await Spectrum({
     projectId: process.env.PROJECT_ID,
     projectSecret: process.env.PROJECT_SECRET,
     providers: [imessage.config()],
   });

   for await (const [space, message] of app.messages) {
     await space.responding(async () => {
       await message.reply("Hello from Spectrum.");
     });
   }
   ```

Spectrum also runs fully standalone — you can connect to a local iMessage database with the separate [`@spectrum-ts/imessage-local`](https://npmjs.com/package/@spectrum-ts/imessage-local) package, bring your own gRPC endpoints, or build your own platform provider. See the [docs](https://docs.photon.codes) for self-hosted setups.

## Platforms

| Platform | Package |
|----------|---------|
| iMessage | [`@spectrum-ts/imessage`](https://npmjs.com/package/@spectrum-ts/imessage) |
| Local iMessage | [`@spectrum-ts/imessage-local`](https://npmjs.com/package/@spectrum-ts/imessage-local) (explicit install only) |
| WhatsApp Business | [`@spectrum-ts/whatsapp-business`](https://npmjs.com/package/@spectrum-ts/whatsapp-business) |
| Telegram | [`@spectrum-ts/telegram`](https://npmjs.com/package/@spectrum-ts/telegram) |
| Slack | [`@spectrum-ts/slack`](https://npmjs.com/package/@spectrum-ts/slack) |
| Terminal | [`@spectrum-ts/terminal`](https://npmjs.com/package/@spectrum-ts/terminal) |
| Custom   | `definePlatform` from `spectrum-ts` |

`bun add spectrum-ts` is batteries-included (the standard provider set; local iMessage is an explicit install). For a smaller install, depend on the runtime plus only the providers you use — `bun add @spectrum-ts/core @spectrum-ts/telegram` — and import from the scoped packages directly. Either way the `spectrum-ts/providers/<platform>` import paths work as long as the matching provider package is installed; if it isn't, the import fails at build/startup naming the exact package to add.
